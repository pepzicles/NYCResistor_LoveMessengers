## About 
Our DIY Love Messengers are the perfect gift for your friends/ partners, especially long-distance ones! When the button of one love messenger is pressed, both of them will light up - no matter HOW FAR AWAY the two messengers are! We will be using all the files, code and 3D models from this repository.
